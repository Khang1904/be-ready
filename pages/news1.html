            <p>
                The 2023-2024 flu season faced significant challenges, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reporting moderate impact. The flu season peaked in late December 2023, with high activity levels lasting until February 2024. The prolonged period of high flu cases put considerable pressure on the healthcare system, as hospitals and clinics worked tirelessly to manage the increased patient load.<br><br>

                Throughout the flu season, approximately 14 million people were affected by the flu, highlighting the widespread nature of the outbreak. The high number of cases led to a significant number of hospitalizations, with around 150,000 people requiring medical care due to severe flu symptoms. This increase in hospitalizations underscores the importance of vaccination and preventive measures to mitigate the impact of such a widespread illness.<br><br>

                Unfortunately, the flu season also resulted in a significant number of deaths, with 9,400 fatalities reported. These numbers serve as a stark reminder of the potential severity of the flu and the need for ongoing public health efforts to combat the virus. As the flu season waned in May 2024, health officials continued to emphasize the importance of flu vaccination and other preventive strategies to protect vulnerable groups and reduce the burden of future flu seasons.
